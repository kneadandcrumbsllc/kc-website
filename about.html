        <p>Welcome to Knead and Crumbs! We are a licensed cottage bakery located in Simsbury, CT specializing in NY-style bagels, gourmet muffins, other breads and sweets.</p>

        <p>I’m Alexandra, though I go by Alex, and I fell in love with baking at a very young age making cookies with my mom during the holidays. That love grew into the need to make the perfect challah, replicate the bagels we were missing from NJ, and make our Goldilocks version of a cupcake (not too dry and not too sweet). My husband (our bagel maker) and I love to host for friends and family, so we have some experience baking a variety of products for a crowd.</p>

        <p>We are currently doing weekly bagel drops with local pickup and delivery in Simsbury, CT on Saturday mornings. Preorders open at 8 am on Tuesdays and close at 7 pm on Fridays. We are also taking custom orders for a variety of bakes if you have an event coming up or just want a sweet treat.</p>

        <p>Writing this still feels like a pinch me moment, but we can’t wait to bake for you soon!</p>
