        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>Ordering & Availability</h3>

			<b>When do preorders open and close?</b><br />
			Preorders open on Tuesdays at 8 am and close on Thursdays at 5 pm or when we sell out (whichever comes first).<br />
			<b>Do you take custom orders?</b><br />
			Fill out our custom order inquiry form, and we’ll work out the details.<br />
			<b>How far in advance should I order?</b><br />
			For our regular menu drops, just follow the preorder schedule. For custom orders, we recommend at least 2–3 weeks' notice (more for large events).<br />
			<b>Do you have a minimum order amount?</b><br />
			Preorders have a $20 minimum. For custom or large event orders, minimums depend on the item.

			<b>Do you offer delivery? If so, what areas do you deliver to?</b><br />
			Yes! We offer local delivery within Simsbury included in the cost of your order.<br />
			<b>What if I’m not from Simsbury?</b><br />

		</p>
		<h3>Menu & Products</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Do you have a set menu or rotating flavors?</b><br />
			We have a few core items available regularly (like NY-style bagels, gourmet muffins and classic cookies) plus seasonal and limited-time flavors that change throughout the year.<br />
			<b>Are your products nut-free/dairy-free/gluten-free?</b><br />
			Our kitchen works with wheat, dairy, eggs, and nuts. While we are happy to try to accommodate certain requests, we cannot guarantee a completely allergen-free environment.<br />
			<b>Do you offer vegan options?</b><br />
			At this time, we don’t offer fully vegan baked goods, but we are always testing recipes—stay tuned!<br />
			<b>Do your products contain allergens?</b><br />
			Yes, many of our products contain common allergens like wheat, dairy, eggs, and soy. Each product will have ingredients listed so you can check before ordering.<br />
			<b>Can you customize flavors, colors, or decorations?</b><br />
			Absolutely! We love customizing treats to fit your vision. Just reach out via the custom order form.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>What payment methods do you accept?</b><br />

			<b>Do you require payment in advance?</b><br />
			Yes—payment is required at checkout to confirm your order.<br />
			<b>What is your cancellation policy?</b><br />
			For preorder items, cancellations must be made before the preorder closes. For custom orders, cancellations must be made at least 7 days in advance for a partial refund.<br />
			<b>What is your refund policy?</b><br />

			Yes! We can package items beautifully for gifting or events. Realtors, event planners, and businesses—send us a message for details.

			<b>Are you licensed to sell baked goods?</b><br />
